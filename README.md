We are a telecommunication company that provides phone and internet services to thousands of people across California, but every month, a significant number decide to leave us for a competitor or simply cancel their service. Our company is bleeding customers, and we don't fully understand why. This "customer churn" is more than just a number, it's lost revenue, wasted marketing expenses, and a sign that we might not be meeting our customers' needs.
