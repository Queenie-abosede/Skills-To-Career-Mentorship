# Telecoms Customer Churn Analysis
## Introduction
We are a telecommunication company that provides phone and internet services to thousands of people across California, but every month, a significant number decide to leave us for a competitor or simply cancel their service. Our company is bleeding customers, and we don't fully understand why. This "customer churn" is more than just a number, it's lost revenue, wasted marketing expenses, and a sign that we might not be meeting our customers' needs.

The core problem is that we lack clarity. We have all this customer data, but we haven't connected the dots to see the story telling us about who is leaving, when they leave, and most importantly, why, which is why we need a customer insight Analyst.


## 📘 Project Overview
The telecommunication company is experiencing customer turnover (churn), which affects revenue stability and growth. However, the reasons behind customer churn are unclear. There’s a need to identify patterns, trends, and key factors influencing churn to guide retention strategies.

The project was executed in Microsoft Excel, featuring two interactive dashboards:
1. Churn Customer Demographics –  detailed breakdowns Customer demographics
2. Customer Churn Analysis – Identofy the trends, patterns and key factors Influenecing Churn


## 🎯 Business Queation
• Is our service portfolio failing us? Which specific service (e.g., Fiber Optic internet, online security, streaming) is most strongly associated with customers leaving?
• What is the gender distribution of churned customers?
• What is our exact customer churn rate? 
• Do specific payment methods or billing structures correlate with higher churn rates? 
• What are the common demographics (like age, gender, Marital status) and contract characteristics (month-to-month vs. yearly) of customers who churn? 
• Does tenure contribute to churn rate?

## 🧰 Methodological Approach
The analysis merges customer behavioral data with zip code demographic information to identify patterns across multiple dimensions. Initial focus includes descriptive analytics to establish baseline metrics, followed by correlation analysis to identify key churn drivers. The final deliverables will provide prioritized recommendations based on both statistical significance and business impact.
The primary tool utilized for data inspection, integrity checking, and cleaning was Microsoft Excel, specifically leveraging its advanced Power Query and filtering features.

## 📈 Method of Analysis
• Overall Churn Rate: Used a pivot table to divide churned customers by total customers, establishing the 26.5% KPI.
• Churn by Contract: Created a stacked column chart using a Pivot-calculated customer status, grouping by contract to reveal Month-to-Month as the most vulnerable.
• Churn by Internet Type: Used a Pivot table in a stacked bar chart to show that the Fiber Optic segment has a churn rate exceeding 50%.
• Key Challenge: Analyzing population impact was difficult due to the "one-to-many" relationship between cities and zip codes, preventing clean data aggregation.

## 📊 Churn Insights 
• **Insight:** Churn is heavily concentrated among month-to-month contract customers (1,655 churners) and those using Fiber Optic internet (70%), indicating dissatisfaction with commitment flexibility and service quality. Customers without online backup and without offers also have significantly higher churn rates. The age range 39–58 shows the highest churn volume, suggesting mid-life customers may have stronger expectations for reliability and pricing.

• **Insight:** A major driver of churn is service dissatisfaction, as seen in the high churn from categories like competitor switching, dissatisfaction, and attitude issues. The absence of online backup and high churn among Fiber Optic customers may signal gaps in technical support responsiveness. Customers with dependents are churn-prone, showing that households may need more reliable and responsive support.

• **Insight:** Churned customers represent a significant revenue loss given the average total charge of $1,531 and the high volume of churn across key segments. The dominance of Fiber Optic churn suggests that high-value customers are leaving. The churn rate of 26.5% impacts long-term cash flow predictability, particularly due to month-to-month contracts.

• **Insight:** The high churn among Fiber Optic users (70%) signals dissatisfaction with performance or reliability, despite it being a premium service. Many customers on basic or no-offer plans are leaving, suggesting unmet expectations in value packaging. Month-to-month contract churn indicates that commitment models may need redesigning.
 
• **Insight:** The organization faces a 26.5% churn rate, with the majority of losses coming from high-value, Fiber Optic customers and month-to-month contracts. This churn is disproportionately driven by dissatisfaction, competitive pressure, and service experience gaps. Churn is highest in prime economic age groups (39–58), which hold significant revenue-generating potential.

       

## 🔍 Recommendations
1. Head of Marking Head should Prioritize a targeted retention campaign for month-to-month customers—offer price incentives, loyalty bonuses, or flexible upgrade plans. Improve perceived value for Fiber Optic users through speed boosts or reduced downtime. Launch personalized retention offers for adults age 38–58, focusing on stability, value, and service assurance.
2. Customer Service Team should Strengthen your first-contact resolution rate and ensure faster escalation for Fiber Optic complaints. Implement a follow-up system for customers who call more than once within 30 days. Train agents on empathy and proactive retention techniques to address “attitude” as a churn reason.
3. Finance Head Team Model the financial impact of reducing churn by 5–10% within the high-value Fiber Optic segment to justify budget for retention campaigns. Re-assess pricing strategy for month-to-month customers, offering bundles that increase retention without significantly affecting ARPU. Allocate funds to improve service reliability, as this directly influences revenue retention.
4. Product and Service Team should prioritize quality improvements in the Fiber Optic offering—speed consistency, uptime, and installation experience. Redesign product bundles to include online backup, offers, or loyalty benefits to increase value perception. Review and enhance the month-to-month contract experience with flexible but attractive upgrade paths.
5. CEO/Executive Management should adopt a company-wide churn reduction strategy that aligns marketing, customer service, product, and technical teams. Invest in service reliability enhancements, especially for Fiber Optic customers. Set quarterly churn-reduction KPIs and prioritize retention as a top-level strategic initiative to protect revenue and competitive positioning.

## 📜 Conclusion

The CEO and executives should lead a cross-departmental effort in Marketing to retain month-to-month Fiber users through targeted offers, Customer Service to enhance Fiber installation and support, Product Team should improve service performance and bundle add-ons for retention, and Finance to fund these initiatives. This coordinated action will strengthen customer loyalty, reduce revenue churn, and protect long-term profitability.
